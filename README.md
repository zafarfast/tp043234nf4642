## Project Description
The Social Media Thought Book AI Picture Generator is an API that allows users of a social media startup to express their emotions through generated pictures created by AI. The API enables users to enter a short sentence expressing their feelings and generate a picture that reflects those emotions. Users can write how they feel about the generated picture and post both the picture and their thoughts to the social media thought book platform.

**User Story**
- As a user of the social media thought book platform
- I want to be able to express my emotions through generated pictures created by AI
- When I enter a short sentence expressing my feelings into the platform, I want the API to generate a picture that reflects my emotions
- Then, I want to be able to write how I feel about the generated picture and post both the picture and my thoughts to the social media thought book platform
- I expect the API to handle any errors that may occur during the process and provide clear error messages to me. By having this functionality, I can better express my emotions and connect with others on the platform who may share similar feelings.


**Acceptance Criteria**
- GIVEN a social media AI network
- When I enter a short sentence expressing my emotions into the social media thought book platform
- Then the API should generate a picture using AI that reflects the emotions expressed in my sentence
- When I write how I feel about the generated picture
- Then the API should allow me to post both the generated picture and my thoughts to the social media thought book platform.
