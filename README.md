**Project Description**
-
The Social Media Thought Book AI Picture Generator is an API that allows users of a social media startup to express their emotions through generated pictures created by AI. The API enables users to enter a short sentence expressing their feelings and generate a picture that reflects those emotions. Users can write how they feel about the generated picture and post both the picture and their thoughts to the social media thought book platform.

The API will be built using AI technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and neural networks. The API will be hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

**User Story**
-
- As a user of the social media thought book platform
- I want to be able to express my emotions through generated pictures created by AI
- When I enter a short sentence expressing my feelings into the platform, I want the API to generate a picture that reflects my emotions
- Then, I want to be able to write how I feel about the generated picture and post both the picture and my thoughts to the social media thought book platform
- I expect the API to handle any errors that may occur during the process and provide clear error messages to me. By having this functionality, I can better express my emotions and connect with others on the platform who may share similar feelings.


**Acceptance Criteria**
-
- GIVEN a social media AI network
- When I enter a short sentence expressing my emotions into the social media thought book platform
- Then the API should generate a picture using AI that reflects the emotions expressed in my sentence
- When I write how I feel about the generated picture
- Then the API should allow me to post both the generated picture and my thoughts to the social media thought book platform.
